# Nocline

üåê Overview:
Nocline is a sensory-infused, symbolic programming language built to bridge emotive logic, signal synchronization, and aesthetic execution in both software and storytelling systems. Designed for reactive environments and narrative engines, Nocline uses human-readable syntax with emotional primitives like scent, signal, and mark‚Äîturning code into a form of symbolic choreography.

It blends traditional logic (loop, if, frame) with emergent concepts such as scent weight resolution, signal bus visualization, and memory-synced emotional states. Every line of Nocline isn‚Äôt just a command‚Äîit‚Äôs a gesture, a pulse, a ripple in system memory tied to perception.

The language runs on a fully custom bytecode VM with optional JIT compilation, a signal stack, and plugins for scent-weight emotional decoding üíÆ. It includes:

A CLI-based compiler: nocline run file.nc

A live web-based REPL: with syntax highlighting + animated bytecode feedback

An embeddable game engine layer for interactive simulation and storytelling

Modular scopes, frames, and emotive triggers designed for living, feeling systems

Whether you‚Äôre building a scent-based simulation, an interactive art game, or a neural scripting engine, Nocline gives you the keys to code in synesthetic signal waves, where emotion meets execution.
